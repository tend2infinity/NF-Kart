# NF-Kart
A real world online NFT(Non Fungible Token) based warranty system.

- Each product in the marketplace is linked to an NFT owned by the marketplace minted on Polygon Blockchain.
Upon purchase of product the ownership of the NFT is transferred to the User.

- The NFT can be used to claim ownership of the product as well as to claim warranty.

- An admin/brand can put their product on the marketplace without any knowledge of blockchain with the help of User Interface.
